# Shiny app for CNV plot
This is a shiny app generated from the output of cnv-seq. It uses the ggplot2 package.
The plots enable comparison of the copy number variation between two whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of a cell line at two different timepoints (60-days and 300-days).

You can select chromosomes to view, or zoom to certain chromosome regions.

To view the plot in your computer, download the whole "cnv_plot" directory and run the app.R (make sure you have R studio installed with the shiny package).

Alternatively, the Shiny app is also accessible here: https://ngs-explorer.shinyapps.io/Chromosome_CNV_viz/
